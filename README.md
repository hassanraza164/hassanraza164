I am Hassan Raza. I am an electrical engineer. I am fond of and work in projects related to machine learning. I also have experience in programming languages like Python, C, 
mysql, arm assembly, MATLAB, LaTex and also have hands-on experience with simulation and developer tools like Cadence (Xcelium, OrCad, virtuoso), 
proteus, LTspice, pyCharm, Simulink, Altium, Code blocks, DevC++, Labview, National instruments, Vivado and also worked on frameworks such as linux, Django, 
google collab. I am currently aiming to advance further in state-of the art machine learning techniques so that I can also progress in fields like robotics, 
prosthetics, medicine and human activity recognition (HAR). I can collaborate with anyone working with above-mentioned fields/techniques. In such case,
feel free to contact me at hassain18071999@gmail.com.
